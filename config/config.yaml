# Feature Extraction Configuration
feature_extraction:
  method: "combined"  # LBP + Color Histogram achieved 69.75% (best so far)
  # Options: histogram_of_oriented_gradients, local_binary_pattern, color_histogram, combined
  hog:
    orientations: 9
    pixels_per_cell: [8, 8]
    cells_per_block: [2, 2]
    visualize: false
  lbp:
    radius: 3
    n_points: 24
    method: "uniform"
  color_histogram:
    bins: 128  # Optimized value (256 was too high, caused overfitting)
    color_space: "HSV"  # HSV performed best in testing
    # Note: Can try LAB color space for better color discrimination
  combined:
    use_hog: false  # HOG performed poorly (20.91%), disabling
    use_lbp: true   # LBP alone: 61.44%
    use_color_hist: true  # Color histogram: 73.19%

# SVM Classifier Configuration
svm:
  kernel: "rbf"  # RBF kernel for better accuracy (with PCA reduction, training is manageable)
  # Options: linear (fast), rbf (more accurate but slower), poly, sigmoid
  C: 200.0  # Increased for better fit (was 50.0)
  gamma: 0.001  # Optimized for combined features
  probability: true  # Required for rejection mechanism
  rejection_threshold: 0.3  # Lowered further to accept more predictions

# k-NN Classifier Configuration
knn:
  n_neighbors: 5  # Optimized value from hyperparameter search
  weights: "distance"  # Options: uniform, distance (distance weighting helps with outliers)
  algorithm: "auto"  # Options: auto, ball_tree, kd_tree, brute
  metric: "manhattan"  # Optimized: manhattan performed better than euclidean
  rejection_threshold: 0.3  # Lowered further to accept more predictions
